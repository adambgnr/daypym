# daypym
Daypym is a project to preprocess and run DAYSIM solar irradiance simulations with Python. It uses EnergyPlus IDF files, as geometry input.

# Features

## Geometry preprocessing

* Translating EnergyPlus IDF geometry to .rad file for DAYSIM simulation (utilizing eppy and geomeppy)

* Generating sensor points over selected surfaces (utilizing geomeppy)

## Running DAYSIM simulations

* Creating folder structure for the simulations

* Writing .hea file for DAYSIM

* Running DAYSIM simulations

## Postprocessing

* Visualizing irradiance simulation results

# Installation
